## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

### Welcome to Spark EV.

Our names are Owen Gregson and Peter Zhao.
We're a team of passionate high-schoolers building an electric car from scratch.
We'll be combining skills from various disciplines, including software engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, mechatronics engineeringâ€”which integrates these fieldsâ€”and more, to complete the project.

We plan to complete our car by the beginning of our senior year of high school, around late 2025.

**Do you own a company in a tech-related field, and are interested in sponsoring this project?**
We'd be more than happy to discuss options with you and help out where we can in exchange for a sponsorship.
