## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

### Welcome to Spark EV.

Our names are Owen Gregson and Peter Zhao.
We're a team of passionate high-school software engineers building an electric car from scratch.
We'll be combining skills from various disciplines including mechatronics, electrical engineering, CAD, physics, and more to complete the project.

We plan to complete our car by the beginning of our senior year of high school.

Sneak peek of our plans:

* Two-seater racer/sedan hybrid
* 0-60mph in ~4.2s
* 0-10mph in ~0.7s
* 60mph Top Speed
* ~90 miles battery range
* Built-in OLED touchscreen display with custom software
* Custom onboard self-driving
