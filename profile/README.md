<h2 id="hey-">Hey! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
<h3 id="welcome-to-spark-ev-">Welcome to Spark EV.</h3>
<p>Our names are Owen Gregson and Peter Zhao.
We're a team of passionate high-schoolers building an electric car from scratch.
We'll be combining skills from various disciplines, including software engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, mechatronics engineeringâ€”which integrates these fieldsâ€”and more, to complete the project.</p>
<p>We plan to complete our car by the beginning of our senior year of high school, around late 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Do you own a company in a tech-related field, and are interested in sponsoring this project?</strong><br>
<p>We'd be more than happy to discuss options with you and help out where we can in exchange for a sponsorship.<br>
